v1.21: Add command-based inventory and item detection

Major changes:
- Add DataCommandListener to capture /data get command results
- Add CommandResultCapture utility for parsing NBT data from logs
- Update TaskExecutor to use data command for inventory retrieval
- Update VisionUpdateTask to detect nearby items via command

Commands used:
- /data get entity @e[tag=test1,limit=1] Inventory (inventory)
- /execute as @e[tag=test1,limit=1] run data get entity @n[type=item] Pos (item position)
- /execute as @e[tag=test1,limit=1] run data get entity @n[type=item] Item (item type)

This fixes issues where:
- Bot could not recognize items in its inventory
- Dropped items near the bot were not detected
